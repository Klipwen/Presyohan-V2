# Presyohan: Export to Google Keep — Project Plan (Web Version)

## 1. Project Purpose / Business Justification

The **Export to Google Keep** feature allows users to quickly turn the store's pricelist into a clean, readable text note that can be saved directly to Google Keep through copy/share actions. This makes price referencing extremely accessible for staff and store owners, especially on mobile.

This aligns with Presyohan’s mission to provide:

* A centralized and easy-to-access pricing reference.
* Fast sharing capabilities for teams.
* Cross-device compatibility without complex integrations.

This approach is chosen because:

* Google Keep does *not* support direct API integration.
* Exporting formatted text and letting users save it to Keep is the most practical, reliable, and professional solution for a web app.

---

## 2. Objectives

1. Provide a button that exports the pricelist as a well-formatted text note.
2. Present a **Preview Modal** showing the final note layout.
3. Implement a **Copy to Clipboard** feature for desktop and mobile.
4. Use the **Web Share API** on supported browsers (Android Chrome).
5. Provide fallback instructions for browsers where sharing is not supported.
6. Maintain a clear, readable structure in the exported text.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In-Scope

### 4.2 Functional Deliverables

**1. Text Formatter**

• Item Name — ₱Price
```

**2. Clipboard API Integration**

### 4.3 Backend (Optional)

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/store/{id}/export-note`

Returns preformatted text.

Alternatively: Frontend can build formatting directly from fetched JSON.

## 5. Professional Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1 — User Clicks Export

1. User opens Pricelist.
2. Clicks **Export to Google Keep**.
3. App fetches product data or calls export endpoint.

### Step 2 — Generate Note

1. Text formatter groups items by category.
2. Formatter builds bullet lists.
3. Modal shows a clean preview.

### Step 3 — User Copies or Shares

1. **If Web Share API supported:**

   * User taps **Share**, selects Google Keep.
2. **If unsupported:**

   * User taps **Copy Note**, then manually pastes into Keep.

### Step 4 — Completion

* Show toast: "Note copied to clipboard!"
* User pastes into Google Keep.

---

## 6. UX Guidelines & Best Practices

* Use monochrome formatting (no emojis unless user adds manually).
* Keep bullets simple to ensure compatibility across devices.
* Use short category headers.
* Limit text width to maximize readability.
* Provide success feedback for copy/share actions.

---

## 7. Final Recommendations

* Keep the export text layout identical across web and mobile.
* Offer one-click **Copy** as default.
* Use Web Share API to maximize convenience for Android users.
* Make preview modal responsive and scrollable.
* Always show fallback guide.

This feature makes sharing prices simple, universal, and highly accessible for all staff—supporting Presyohan’s goal of fast, centralized pricing management.

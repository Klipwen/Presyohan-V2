Presyohan: Import Prices — Project Plan (Android Version)
1. Project Purpose / Business Justification

The Import Prices (Android Version) feature enables store owners to import pricelists directly from their mobile devices using TXT files, pasted text, or shared content from apps like Google Keep. The Android app simplifies price updates by allowing users to manage pricing on-the-go, even without a computer.

This aligns with Presyohan’s goals to:

Provide full price management directly from mobile

Support the natural workflow of store owners who rely heavily on phones

Minimize manual encoding by enabling “paste or share to Presyohan” actions

Maintain consistency with the web parsing system

This approach is chosen because:

Many users store pricelists in Google Keep on mobile.

Android’s Share Intent makes importing fast and seamless.

TXT-based import does not require third-party API integrations.

Mobile-first design increases accessibility for small business owners.

2. Accepted Format Specification (Same as Web)

The Android importer must accept the same standardized format to ensure cross-platform consistency.

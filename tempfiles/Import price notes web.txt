Presyohan: Import Prices — Project Plan (Web Version)
1. Project Purpose / Business Justification

The Import Prices (Web Version) feature allows store owners to quickly upload, paste, or import pricelists into Presyohan using standardized formats such as TXT files or text exported from Google Keep. This makes price encoding faster, reduces mistakes, and ensures up-to-date pricing across the entire store.

This aligns with Presyohan’s mission to provide:

Consistent and accurate item pricing

Faster setup for new stores

Cross-device compatibility (desktop → mobile)

Minimal manual data entry

A clean and user-friendly workflow for store owners

This approach is chosen because:

Many store owners store price lists in Google Keep, Notes, or TXT.

Manual encoding is error-prone and time-consuming.

Providing a paste/import feature requires no external API integrations.

TXT-based formats are universal across devices.

2. Accepted Format Specification

The importer must accept structured text like this:

PRICELIST:
QSOS 2 — Curva Medellin, Cebu
11/25/2025

[ALCOHOL/LIQUOR]
• Alfonso Light (alfonso) — ₱375.00
• Club Mix (lime juice) — ₱80.00
• Red Horse (beer) — ₱145.00

[CIGARETTES]
• Camel (Camel yellow) — ₱1,400.00
• Marlboro (Marlboro red) — ₱9.00

Parsing Rules

Header lines (PRICELIST:, Store Name, Date) are optional.

Categories are detected via:
[CATEGORY]

Items must follow one of two formats:

• Name (description) — ₱Price

• Name — ₱Price

Descriptions inside parentheses are optional.

Duplicate items under the same category must be flagged.

Prices can be:

₱145.00

145

145.0

3. Core Functional Requirements (Web)
3.1 Import Sources

The Web version must allow:

Upload TXT file

Paste raw text

Import Excel (already implemented)

All import methods must use the same parsing engine.

3.2 Parser Responsibilities

The Web parser must:

Detect and map categories

Extract product name

Detect optional descriptions

Parse price formats

Clean/truncate extra spaces

Normalize special characters (—, -, “•”)

Identify duplicates

Identify invalid entries (wrong format, missing price, missing name)

4. User Flow (Web Version)
Step 1 — Navigation

Settings → Manage Store → Import Prices

Step 2 — Choose Import Method

Tabs:

Import TXT

Paste Text

Import Excel

Step 3 — Parse Input

The system reads the content and produces:

Category

Item Name

Description (optional)

Price

Status:

New Item

Duplicate Item

Will Update Existing Price

Invalid Format

Step 4 — Preview Modal

A preview table appears:

Category	Item	Description	Price	Status

User chooses:

Import All

Import Only Valid Items

Cancel


5. Error Handling
Invalid Format

Missing category

Missing price

No recognizable item lines

Wrong dash format

No numeric price

Show:
⚠️ “Some items could not be processed. Please review the highlighted entries.”

Duplicate Detection

Same name & category

Option to overwrite price or skip

6. Role Access

Only Store Owners can access Import Prices.

Staff accounts can only view imported price lists — not upload or change them.
